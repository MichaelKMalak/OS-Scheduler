## Introduction
A CPU scheduler determines an order for the execution of its scheduled processes; it decides which process will run according to a certain data structure that keeps track of the processes in the system and their status.

A process after creation has one of the three states: Running, Ready, Blocked (doing I/O , using other resources than CPU or waiting on unavailable resource).

A bad scheduler will make a very bad Operating System, so a scheduler should be as much optimized as possible in terms of memory and time usage.

## System Description
Consider a Computer with CPU and infinite memory, the scheduler with its complementary components as the following
![system description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelKMalak/OS-Scheduler/master/sample/main_system_components.PNG)

### Part 1: Process generator  (Objective: For simulation & IPC)
#### Code file: processGenerator.cpp
Process generator: responsible for
* Reading the input files (check Part 5)
* Ask the user about the chosen scheduling Algorithm and its parameters if exists.
* Initiate and create Scheduler and Clock processes.
* Creating a data structure for process and provide it with its parameters
* Send the information to the scheduler at the appropriate time (only when a process arrives) so
that it will be put it in its turn.
* At the end it Clear IPC Resources.

### Part 2: Clock  (Objective: For simulation & IPC)
#### Code file: clk.cpp
The clock module is used to emulate a integer time clock
headers.h contains clk functions. 
It should be included anywhere the clock functions are used.
To get time call, use: 
  <br>`getClk();`  
  
### Part 3 : Scheduler (Objective: OS Design, IPC)
#### Code file: scheduler.cpp
The scheduler is the core of this project, it should keep track of the processes and their states and it decides â€“ based on the used algorithm - which process will run & for how long.

The scheduler consists of mainly three Algorithms:
1. non-preemptive HPF
2. Shortest Remaining time Next
3. Round Robin

The scheduling algorithm only works on the processes in the ready queue; a process that already arrived.

The Scheduler should be able to
* Start a new process according to the scheduling algorithm.(Fork it and give its parameters)
* Switch between two processes according to the scheduling algorithm. (Stop the old process and
save its state and start/resume another one)
* At anytime, it should have a process control Block that keeps track of the state of the processes
in the system (running/waiting/execution time/ remaining time/ waiting time/ ...etc)
* If the scheduler is notified that a process finished, it delete its data.

When a process finishes it should notify the scheduler on termination, the scheduler doesn't terminate the process.

For each algorithm, the code reports:
* CPU utilization.
* average weighted turnaround time.
* average waiting time.
* standard deviation for average weighted turnaround time.

The Scheduler Generates two files: (check Part 5)
* Scheduler.log
* Scheduler.perf

### Part 4 : process (Objectives: simulation, IPC)
#### Code file: process.cpp
The process should act as if runs in the execution time, the process communicate with clock functions.

### Part 5 : Input / output (Objectives: simulation, evaluation OS Design)
#### Input:
